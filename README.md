## Introduction
This repo contains the javascript code for the concepts I learned during the "Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB" course on Coursera. It also contains the assignment work which I did to get the credits for this course. Check my certificate [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/GDNNQP4VUQRT), and also this check this amazing course over [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs).


## Prerequisites Tools

- **MongoDB :**
You will require a database on which the queries can be executed. Refer the [this](https://www.mongodb.com/) to get the MongoDB. Replace the credentials in [this](./config.js) file to get connected with your database.

- **Postman :**
To start sending different requests (GET, PUT,...) to your back-end you can use Postman or you can also create the front-end and make requests using javascript. To get the postman check [this](https://www.postman.com/).
